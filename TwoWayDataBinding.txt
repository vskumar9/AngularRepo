Angular's ngModel directive is used to achieve two-way data binding.

Here's how two-way data binding using ngModel works:
1. Importing FormsModule
2. Binding Component Property to Input Element
3. Updating Component Property and Input Element

==============================================================

2. Using ngModel directive in the template
3. Binding the ngModel directive to a property in the component class
4. Updating the property in the component class
5. The view will automatically update when the property changes
