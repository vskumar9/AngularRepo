Structural directives are powerful tools that allow you to conditionally render or 
Repeat elements in the DOM based on dynamic conditions.

Angular provides several build-in structural directives that you can use out of the box:
- `ngIf` - Conditionally renders a template based on a boolean expression.
- `ngSwitch` - Conditionally renders a template based on a value.
- `ngFor` - Iterates over an array or object and renders a template for each item
- `ngTemplateOutlet` - Renders a template based on a reference to a template variable.
