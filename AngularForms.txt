Forms are an essential part of many web applications, allowing users to input and
submit data. However, they can also be a source of security vulnerabilities if not
properly implemented.

There are two approaches to working with forms in angular:
Template-Driven Froms
Reactive Forms
### Template-Driven Forms
Template-Driven Forms are the most common approach to working with forms in Angular. They are called "
template-driven" because the form is defined in the HTML template, and Angular takes care of the rest
The main advantage of Template-Driven Forms is that they are easy to use and require minimal code.
However, they can be less flexible and less powerful than Reactive Forms.
Uses Template-Driven Froms:
-- Contact forms:
-- Login forms:
-- Quick data entry forms:

### Reactive Forms
Reactive Forms are a more powerful and flexible approach to working with forms in Angular. They are called
"reactive" because they use the Angular's reactive programming model to handle form data.
The main advantage of Reactive Forms is that they are more powerful and flexible than Template-Driven Forms.
They are also more suitable for complex forms and forms with dynamic structure.
Uses Reactive Forms:
-- Multi-step forms:
-- Forms with dynamic controls:
-- Forms with complex validation rules:
-- Custom form validation:
-- Advanced form handling
