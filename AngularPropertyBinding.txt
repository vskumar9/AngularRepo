Property binding is a type of one-way data binding in angular that allows you to set the
value of an HTML element's property based on a component property or expression.

Here's how property binding works:

1. Binding Component Properties to Element Properties
2. Binding Expressions to Element Properties
3. Binding Component Methods to Element Properties
4. Binding Component Properties to Element Attributes
5. Binding Component Properties to Element Styles
