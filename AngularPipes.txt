Pipes in Angular are a way to transform and format data for display in the template.
Pipes are used to format data, such as dates, numbers, and strings, and to perform
other data transformations. They are used to perform common data manipulation tasks such as
filtering, sorting, and formatting values. Pipes are marked with the | character in the template syntax.
