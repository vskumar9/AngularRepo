Angular Life Cyle

Each Angular component goes through 8 phases in its lifecycle. When it is initialized, 
it creates and presents its root components. For the components that get loaded during 
application development, it keeps checking when the data binding properties are getting 
changed and updated. When the component is not used anymore, it approaches the death phase 
and is decimated and expelled from the DOM

Angular Decorators

An Angular Decorator is a function, using which we attach metadata to a class, method, accessor, property, or parameter
We apply the decorator using the form @expression, where expression is the name of the decorator.
The Decorators are Typescript features and are still not part of the Javascript.

Angular Component

The Component is the main building block of an Angular Application. The Component contains 
the data &amp; user interaction logic that defines how the View looks and behaves.

Angular Module

The Angular module (also known as ngModule) helps us to organize the application parts 
into cohesive blocks of functionality.
