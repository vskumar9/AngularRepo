What are Angular Directives

The Angular directive helps us to manipulate the DOM. You can change the 
appearance, behavior, or layout of a DOM element using the Directives. 
They help you to extend HTML

Angular Structural Directives

Structural directives are directives which change the DOM layout by adding 
and removing DOM elements. Angular provides a set of built-in structural 
directives (such as NgIf, NgForOf, NgSwitch and others) which are commonly 
used in all Angular projects. For more information see Built-in directives.

Angular nglf Directive

A structural directive that conditionally includes a template based on the 
value of an expression coerced to Boolean. When the expression evaluates to 
true, Angular renders the template provided in a then clause, and when false 
or null, Angular renders the template provided in an optional else clause. 
The default template for the else clause is blank.

Angular ngStyle Directive

An attribute directive that updates styles for the containing HTML element. 
Sets one or more style properties, specified as colon-separated key-value pairs. 
The key is a style name, with an optional .<unit> suffix (such as 'top.px', 
'font-style.em'). The value is an expression to be evaluated.
