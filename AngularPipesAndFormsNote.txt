Angular Pipes

Angular Pipes take data as input and formats or transform the data to 
display in the template. We use them to change the appearance of the data 
before presenting it to the user.

Angular Forms

Forms are very integral and essential building blocks of every apps. Forms 
allow us to gather information and data from the user. A good way to interact 
with users and almost all websites will need forms in some other way.

Angular Template Driven Form

Forms built with this directive could only be tested in an end to end test 
because this requires the presence of a DOM, but still, this mechanism was 
very useful and simple to understand. Angular now provides an identical 
mechanism named also ngModel, that allow us to build what is now called 
Template-Driven forms.

Angular Reactive Form

Reactive forms provide a model-driven approach to handling form inputs whose 
values change over time. This guide shows you how to create and update a basic 
form control, progress to using multiple controls in a group, validate form 
values, and create dynamic forms where you can add or remove controls at run time.
