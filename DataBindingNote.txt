Angular Data Binding (One way and Two way Data Binding)

Data binding is a technique, where the data stays in sync 
between the component and the view. Whenever the user updates 
the data in the view, Angular updates the component. When 
the component gets new data, Angular updates the view. There are 
many uses of data binding.

Angular Interpolation

Interpolation allows us to include expressions as part of any 
string literal, which we use in our HTML. The angular evaluates 
the expressions into a string and replaces it in the original 
string and updates the view.

Angular Property Binding

The Property binding allows us to bind HTML element property to a 
property in the component. Whenever the value of the component 
changes, Angular updates the element property in the View. You 
can set the properties such as class, href, src, textContent, etc 
using property binding.

Angular Event Binding

Event binding allows us to bind events such as keystrokes, clicks, 
hover, touch, etc. to a method in the component. It is one way 
from view to component. By tracking the user events in the view 
and responding to them, we can keep our component in sync with 
the view.

Angular Data Binding - Two way data binding (ngModel)

Two-way data binding means that changes made to our model in 
the component are propagated to the view and that any changes 
made in the view are immediately updated in the underlying 
component data.
